# wave-radar
Full-stack flood monitoring dashboard (48-hour sprint). This project demonstrates a decoupled architecture, with a multi-page JavaScript frontend consuming a Python/FastAPI backend. The API serves simulated JSON data and static assets to populate a live dashboard, an AI-driven reports page, and an analytics chart display.
